# Security Basic - 2 - Solution

## Exercise

Implement the logic to load the user from the database in the `CustomUserDetailsService`.

Enable one or more security annotation methods.

Use the annotations to configure the following security requirements:
- Admin users can access `/default/admin`
- Staff users can access `/default/staff`
- User users can access `/default/user`
- Authenticated users can access `/default/authenticated`
- Anyone can access `/default/open`

You know when the exercise is successfully completed when all the tests are green.
